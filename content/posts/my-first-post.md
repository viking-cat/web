I have a new shining computer! My collection of computers and equipment in the office is growing like always. The new computer is really nice, I didn't understand how slow the old one was until this one arrived. I take pride in making electronics last as long as possible, a great example is smartphones, I am a heavy user of them and do all kinds of stuff but I have not bought a new one for a very, very long time. My last few smarphones where inherited from my girlfriend and she even forcefully bought and replaced one of the old ones :D So it is rare for me to invest a lot of money in a completely new and powerful computer. The reason for this investment is that I first of all wanted to learn and experiment with AI. It is very important as a software developer to grow and this lead me to start looking into GPU Compute as well.

So I have a new computer, and I realized almost immediately that it is very painful to install and configure everything after tinkering with computers for 30 years. I wonder how much I have forgotten and I sat there scratching my head just a day ago when I could not remember how I configured something, just like I want it, in the past. This is the primary reason why I have created this website. I intend to compile a list of software that I commonly install and use while also creating guides for how I like to set up things so that it becomes easier the next time I reinstall or buy a completely new computer. This will become even more important for me in the future as the internet continue to get filled with "SEO Slop".

My professional titel also include "senior" and I often interact with less experienced developers so I will most likely create guides and curate lists of tutorials etc so that I can refer to them when helping and teaching others. Hopefully this will over time become a resource that can and will help others as well.
